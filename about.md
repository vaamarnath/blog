# About

I am V. A. Amarnath. I am currently working as a software developer at
VMware India. Previously, I was at IIT Guwahati spending time in delving
into Theoretical Computer Science as part of my Ph.D. I dropped out of the
Ph.D. program after earning my master's degree in Computer Science and Engg.
Earlier, I had earned my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engg. from
NIT Calicut.

While I was at NIT Calicut I had spent my time promoting and exploring
Free and Open Source Philosophy. Right now, I am just passive follower and supporter
of the movement.

I have spent some time at Bangalore working for McAfee India and the only part
that stood out during that phase of my life is my passion for cycling. It was
great to cycle in Bangalore in early mornings and beating traffic while commuting
to office. Now, I am back in Bangalore, commuting again to VMware office by cycle.
